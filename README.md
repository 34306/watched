# watched
An open source tweak that help end-users can paired your own Apple Watch on new watchOS version with old iOS

# Since I do some reverse, I checked that another app is using the same method for pairing.
So feel free to use it. There's no risk or any chance that cause damage to your iPhone or Apple Watch. You can even restore your newer backup of your Apple Watch without any restriction (tested). But be careful about your data lost, I'm not respone for that.
That app basically hook somes function in NanoRegistry.framework to make "Plugins" like PingMySupport,...

# Support iOS 12.0 and later with watchOS 10.3.1 and even newer (upto watchOS 18).
Hopefully version 1.1 can help download app from AppStore... I'm not tested yet.
